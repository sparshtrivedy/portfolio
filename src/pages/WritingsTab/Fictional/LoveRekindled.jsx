                                As Naina neatly packed her intricately embroidered Saris and Lehengas into her suitcase, her mother quietly observed her from the doorway, her hands folded tightly and her feet nervously tapping against the hardwood floor, gradually getting faster and louder. Naina knew her mother didn’t approve, but she didn’t want to start the same conversation again.

                            <Typography variant={'body1'} mb={2}>
                                Her mother finally broke her silence, “Why are you doing this Naina? I am sure Aditi will understand. How can you share a room with someone you just broke up with? Don’t go. You are still not over him.”
                            </Typography>
                            <Typography variant={'body1'} mb={2}>
                                Naina paused her packing, turned to her mother, and said, “Ma, I can’t keep having the same conversation over and over. Aditi is like a sister to me; we have known each other since middle school. I have to go. Kabir and I are adults; I am sure we can put aside our differences for a week, for Aditi.”

                            <Typography variant={'body1'} mb={2}>
                                Her mother’s eyes softened, she walked up to her, gently placing her hands on Naina’s shoulders. “Okay beta. Take care of yourself and don’t hesitate to call if you feel overwhelmed. We’re here for you no matter what.”
                            </Typography>

                                The next morning Naina left for the airport where she was to meet Kabir for the first time since their breakup a month ago. In the weeks leading up to their break-up, they had felt a growing emotional disconnect between them. Despite the deep love for each other, they had started noticing a growing pattern of miscommunication and misunderstandings that kept piling up, resulting in frequent fights, causing them to drift apart. They felt they were no longer the same people they had fallen in love with seven years ago and that a breakup was the best way to figure out what they wanted in life.

                                Sitting in the backseat of her Uber, Naina started out the window, lost in her own world, oblivious to the hustle and bustle of the Delhi streets during Durga Pooja (a popular Indian festival). The sunlight was just starting to filter through the dense smog. Despite it being fairly early in the morning, the streets were already a chaos, probably in preparation for the pooja. The Uber passed by several elaborately decorated pooja pandals, huge crowds gathering around to catch a glimpse of Goddess Durga, beautifully adorned, placed on an ornate pedestal decorated with flowers and drapes.

                            <Typography variant={'body1'} mb={2}>
                                Amidst all the vivacious energy around her, Naina just sat there staring out the window, a whirlwind of thoughts raced through her mind. The anticipation and anxiety surrounding the trip with Kabir filled her with uncertainty. How were they going to share a hotel room? Who would take the bed, and who would settle for the couch? The thought of being in such close proximity to Kabir for a whole week was weighing on her.
                            </Typography>
                            <Typography variant={'body1'} mb={2}>
                                They had booked their hotel room and flights several months in advance, back when they were still together, and now they were stuck having to share a hotel room and sit next to each other on a gruelling seven-hour flight. They had tried to switch, but there were no vacancies this late in peak festival season. They had no option but to bear each other for a week.

                            <Typography variant={'body1'} mb={2}>
                                Among other thoughts, there were some questions nagging her. Was Kabir over her already? Did he have a new girlfriend? Did he win the break-up? The thought of Kabir moving on and being happy without her added to her anxiety. She wished him well but wasn’t ready to see him move on to someone else just yet. The competitive aspect of “wining the breakup” gnawed at her and she began questioning her readiness for the trip.
                            </Typography>
                            <Typography variant={'body1'} mb={2}>
                                Unable to resist her curiosity, Naina immediately pulled out her phone and started stalking Kabir on Instagram, from her finsta (fake Instagram) account, hoping to gain some intel on any potential love interests. In Kabir’s last Instagram post, he had posted some pictures with a girl, Natasha. “That must be his new girlfriend”, Naina thought to herself. She couldn’t have Kabir believe that she was still hung up on him and lonely while he was sipping martinis on the beach with his new girlfriend. That’s when she came up with the brilliant idea to cook up an imaginary boyfriend to boast about. This was a new low for Naina. As she approached the airport, Naina took a moment to touch up her makeup, fix her hair, and spritz on the perfume with Kabir’s favourite scent. She was ready to show him just how over him she was.

                            <Typography variant={'body1'} mb={2}>
                                With a cheerful demeanor, Naina walked up-to Kabir, who was already waiting for her at the airport. She gave him a hug and asked in a nonchalant tone, “Hey, Kabir! How are you doing? Excited for Aditi’s wedding?”. Kabir appeared visibly caught off guard, not expecting Naina to be so upbeat and greet him as if they hadn’t just ended a seven-year relationship a month ago.
                            </Typography>
                            <Typography variant={'body1'} mb={2}>
                                Kabir responded, “Hey Naina, all good. Yeah, looking forward to the wedding. How are you doing?” He spoke in a genuinely curious tone, wanting to know how she was dealing with the breakup.
                            </Typography>
                            <Typography variant={'body1'} mb={2}>
                                Naina replied without hesitation, “Yeah I am dating someone”. A fitting reply to the question that was just asked.
                            </Typography>
                            <Typography variant={'body1'} mb={2}>
                                After a brief pause, Kabir replied, “Oh. Okay. That’s great. Good for you!” He tried to maintain a façade of happiness, but it was evident that the news affected him. He did not probe any further. He probably didn’t want to know the details. “Let’s check-in?” Kabir suggested, and they both made their way to check-in counter, leaving the topic unexplored. Naina was very proud of herself. She could see that the news affected him, and she was coming out on top and “winning the break-up”. They didn’t talk all the way through check-in, security check and at the boarding gates. There was clear tension, and they were visibly uncomfortable around each other. This silence persisted as they sat next to each other in the plane.

                            <Typography variant={'body1'} mb={2}>
                                Naina always got anxious during landing and take-offs, and Kabir could see her fiddling and shifting in her seat as the plane prepared for take-off. They were no longer a couple though, so Kabir hesitated to reach out and offer the reassuring hand he did back when they were together.
                            </Typography>
                            <Typography variant={'body1'} mb={2}>
                                As the plane roared down the runway, gaining speed, Naina involuntarily culched onto Kabir’s arm, squeezing her eyes shut, mumbling a silent prayer. This unexpected gesture warmed Kabir’s heart, bringing back memories of all the trips they had taken together as a couple.
                            </Typography>
                            <Typography variant={'body1'} mb={2}>
                                As the plane came to cruise, Naina opened her eyes, realizing she had clung to Kabir’s arm instinctively. She immediately withdrew her hand, apologizing, “Oh sorry, I didn’t mean to -”.
                            </Typography>
                            <Typography variant={'body1'} mb={2}>
                                “Oh, it’s okay. Don’t worry about it. I know how anxious you get around take-offs and landings.”, Kabir reassured her, offering a gentle smile.
                            </Typography>
                            <Typography variant={'body1'} mb={2}>
                                This was the icebreaker they needed, and they finally began to talk a little. They reminisced about all the trips they embarked on together - café hopping in Paris, relaxing on the beaches of Mauritius, and exploring the charming places of Jodhpur, the city where their love story began. These memories stirred emotions that had remained dormant during their time apart. Then the conversation finally circled back to Naina’s new boyfriend.

                            <Typography variant={'body1'} mb={2}>
                                “So, you have a new boyfriend, huh? That was quick,” said Kabir.
                            </Typography>
                            <Typography variant={'body1'} mb={2}>
                                “Well, yeah, he’s great. We met at a house party. How about you? How is your dating life?”
                            </Typography>
                            <Typography variant={'body1'} mb={2}>
                                “Well, I don’t think I am ready to jump back into dating just yet. I was confined to my room for several weeks. You put quite the spell on me I guess. I only recently went out when my sister, Natasha, came to visit for a week.”
                            </Typography>
                            <Typography variant={'body1'} mb={2}>
                                The realization dawned on her. Naina felt stupid for assuming he had a girlfriend and fabricating a boyfriend based on that assumption.
                            </Typography>
                            <Typography variant={'body1'} mb={2}>
                                After a moment of silence Naina said, “If I’m being honest, I am not dating either. I saw your post on Instagram with Natasha and assumed she was your girlfriend. I feel silly now, sorry.” Naina was extremely embarrassed, her cheeks flushed with self-consciousness, fearing Kabir might see her as a creepy stalker. She began to doubt the wisdom in her honesty.
                            </Typography>
                            <Typography variant={'body1'} mb={2}>
                                But suddenly, Kabir’s laughter broke the tension, and Naina joined in. This was followed by a light roasting session of Naina by Kabir. It reminded Naina of the old times when they would tease each other in such moments.
                            </Typography>
                            <Typography variant={'body1'} mb={2}>
                                Kabir and Naina found themselves immersed in interesting conversations, sharing memories. They recounted how they had grown as individuals over the past month, learning to navigate life on their own. They spoke of how the most insignificant and mundane things reminded them of each other.
                            </Typography>
                            <Typography variant={'body1'} mb={2}>
                                With every word spoken, every shared memory, and every smile exchanged, Naina felt a familiar fluttering in her stomach. She felt warmth emanating in her chest as the dormant love she had for Kabir began to rekindle, flooding her with a rush of feelings. She found herself getting lost in Kabir’s dark brown eyes. She found comfort and excitement in his company.
                            </Typography>
                            <Typography variant={'body1'} mb={2}>
                                Amidst all these feelings, doubt began to creep in. Naina couldn’t help but feel it was wrong and question herself. Was it just that she missed him or was there something still to be explored? Was she being naïve? Uncertainty clouded the happiness she had felt just moments ago. She wasn’t sure if Kabir felt the same either. Should she give up on this love in fear of it failing again? Should she not even try? She experienced a rollercoaster of feelings leaving her with all these unanswered questions.
                            </Typography>
                            <Typography variant={'body1'} mb={2}>
                                As the plane prepared for landing, Kabir offered his arm to Naina, and she leaned in closer, smiling at him. There was something about that longing gaze that spoke volumes. There was an undeniable warmth in their connection.

                                When they picked up their bags, Kabir took gave a deep sigh, turned to Naina, his voice soft and sincere. “Naina, being on this flight with you, talking, laughing, and remembering all the good times we have had... it has made me realize how much I’ve missed you.”
                            </Typography>
                            <Typography variant={'body1'} mb={2}>
                                Naina’s heart skipped a beat, a smile spread across her face, and all the uncertainty was now extinguished. “Kabir, I have been feeling the same way. I too want to give us another chance.”

                                Their hands intertwined, they left the airport, hopeful about what the future had in store for them.
